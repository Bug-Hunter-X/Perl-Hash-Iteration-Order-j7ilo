This example demonstrates an uncommon issue in Perl related to the iteration order of hashes.  While seemingly straightforward, the order in which keys are processed during a foreach loop over a hash's keys is not defined and may vary unexpectedly. This can lead to subtle and difficult-to-debug problems if the code relies on a particular iteration order. The solution offers a way to ensure predictable iteration, if needed.
